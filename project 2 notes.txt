Step 1: Backend Setup
Objective: Ensure database and API endpoints are ready for front-end integration.

1. Database
   - Add other tables for managing quotes, orders, and bills based on project requirements.

2. API Endpoints
   - Set up authentication-related endpoints:
     - `/register`: Accept user details and save them to the database.
     - `/login`: Validate user credentials and generate JWT tokens.
   - Set up endpoints for other features (quotes, orders, bills).
     - E.g., `/quotes`, `/orders`, `/bills`.
   - Ensure all protected endpoints validate JWT tokens.

---
Step 2: Frontend Setup
Objective: Build the foundational structure of your front-end React application.

1. File Structure
   - Organize your files into meaningful folders:
     ```
     src/
     ├── components/
     │   ├── Register.js
     │   ├── Login.js
     │   ├── Dashboard.js
     │   ├── Profile.js
     │   ├── AdminDashboard.js
     │   ├── QuoteManagement.js
     │   ├── OrderManagement.js
     │   └── BillingManagement.js
     ├── App.js
     ├── index.js
     ├── utils.js
     ├── PrivateRoute.js
     ├── styles.css
     └── api/
         ├── auth.js
         ├── quotes.js
         ├── orders.js
         └── bills.js
     ```

2. Start with Core Setup
   - `App.js` and `index.js`:
     - Set up routing and entry point.
     - Use React Router for navigation (already included in your files).

   - `utils.js`:
     - Create helper functions like decoding JWT tokens.

3. Build Shared Components
   - `PrivateRoute.js`:
     - Set up logic to secure protected routes with JWT validation.
   - Navigation/Menu Component:
     - Create a reusable navigation bar based on user/admin roles.

---
Step 3: Core Features
Objective: Develop core user-facing features first.

1. User Registration and Login
   - Start with `Register.js`:
     - Implement the form and backend connection for user registration.
   - Then `Login.js`:
     - Add form validation, connect to the backend, and handle JWT storage.

2. User Dashboard
   - Build a basic dashboard for users to view their quotes, orders, and bills.
   - Add placeholders for features like submitting a quote or paying a bill.

---
Step 4: Admin Features
Objective: Add features for admin workflows.

1. Admin Dashboard
   - Start with a simple layout for viewing all quotes.
   - Incrementally add features for managing orders and bills.

2. Detailed Management Pages
   - Quote Management:
     - Implement features for reviewing and responding to quotes.
   - Order Management:
     - Add features for marking orders as complete.
   - Billing Management:
     - Add features for generating bills and handling disputes.

---
Step 5: Final Enhancements
Objective: Add polish and additional functionalities.

1. Styling and Responsiveness
   - Use CSS or a library like Bootstrap to make the UI visually appealing.
   - Test on different screen sizes.

2. Testing
   - Write tests using Jest or React Testing Library (e.g., for `Login.js`, `Register.js`, `PrivateRoute.js`).

3. Reports and Metrics
   - Implement revenue reports and client categorization for the admin.

4. Deployment
   - Deploy to a server (e.g., XAMPP for local testing, or a hosting service like Heroku).

Development Order Summary
1. Database Setup
2. Backend Endpoints
3. Core Frontend (`App.js`, `index.js`, `PrivateRoute.js`)
4. User Features (`Register.js`, `Login.js`, `Dashboard.js`)
5. Admin Features (`AdminDashboard.js`, `QuoteManagement.js`, etc.)
6. Styling and Testing
7. Deployment
